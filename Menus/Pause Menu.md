# Functionality
- Music - Should we stop the music, reduce the timescale of the music, or create a pause menu theme?
- Resume button - Stops the game
- Settings button - Adjust the settings (same functionality as Main Menu)
- Inventory button - Formatted like the Corpse Loot menu but uses the player instead (i.e. five regions with parts and a description for each part)
	- Should find a way to display mods here as well
- Quit button - Exits the game to the Main Menu
