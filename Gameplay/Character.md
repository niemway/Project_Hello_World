Players and enemies both share the same [[Robot Customization]] system of part swapping, apart from the use of [[Gameplay/Mods|Mods]].

A basic structure of one of the bots is as follows:
- [[#Core]]
	- [[#Parts]]
		- Sensors (2)
		- Arms (2)
		- Legs
- [[#Controller]]

# Core
Every robot has a core. This is responsible for tracking position, core health and sending events to the arms. This is what must be destroyed for a robot to be considered dead. 
# Parts
Every robot has 5 part slots, 2 sensors, 2 arms and 1 pair of legs.
These are swappable with parts from other robots (more info in [[Robot Customization]])
# Controller
