# Terminal
Upon using the health station, the game is automatically saved and the player's respawn point is changed.

Terminal should support various commands for lore and easter eggs
(i.e. query Kernel -> os bible)
## save current loadout

When a player dies and respawns, they will have whatever loadout was last stored.

## load saved loadout
