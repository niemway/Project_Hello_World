# How to use
# Visual Design
# Terminal
Upon using the health station, the game is automatically saved and the player's respawn point is changed.
## query
Terminal should support various commands for lore and easter eggs
(i.e. query Kernel -> os bible)
## store loadout
saves the player's current combination of arms, sensors and legs.
When a player dies and respawns, they will have whatever loadout was last stored.
